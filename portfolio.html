<section id="About-Me">
    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
        Born in Charlotte, NC, I grew up in a big city surrounded by family and friends.
        As I grew up, my interest in the cultural arts grew. 
        I began schooling in acting from an early age when my mother sent my brother and I to summer theatre camps. 
        This evolved into drama classes, then attendance at an arts high school, an NC Governer's School West session, 
        and finally attending the University of North Carolina at Greensboro for a B.A. in theatre. 
        During my late teen years, however, I was discovering that my interest in theatre stemmed largely from film. 
        Shortly after moving to the Triad area, my twin brother and I entered as a team into the Greensboro 48 Film Project.
        It was here that I discovered my love for film and furthered my drive to create art through an ensemble.  
        After a semester at UNCG for theatre, I dropped out. Taking time off from school allowed me to discover passions, explore adulthood,
        and focus on future career skills and motivations. In 2018, I came back to school to pursue a B.A. in Media Studies.
    <br>
    <br>
        Since then, I have taken on numerous film and televised projects, completed 7+ Greensboro 48 Hour Film Projects, 
        filmed various sporting events including collegiate sports, and finally realized I wanted to learn code. I have always wanted
        my own website for my videography business but unfortunately was not able to pay others to make one for me. So, I decided I wanted to
        do it myself. My interest in code actually sparked an interest in it as a career, and so I undertook a coding bootcamp. 
        I am currently learning full stack web development, and hope that this site is a testimony to my newfound skills. 

        I am a firm believer in human rights for all. In the past, I have been an activist and avid supporter for LGBTQ+ rights.
        As a visibly tattooed professional and gender non-conforming artist, I believe that self-expression is central to the quality and nature of the work I do. 
        Finally, as a multimedia project specialist, I know that putting my creative touch on a piece of work will always lead to more satisfying
        and fulfilling end results.
